//---------------------------Menus--------------------------
//This .dic file is primarily concerned with the double-click menus for each of your ghosts. If you don't want to have menus for your characters, you'd just have to delete the OnMouseDoubleClick functions near the end of mouse.dic and then ignore this file, as none of it will be called I believe. Menus can be cool though, since you can put stuff in them and create new functions if you know what you're doing. For example, I've added a lot of games and interactions and little linked icons to my Hunter Smoker ghost to keep track of their feelings and such. Much of that is pretty complicated though (and kind of messy, cough), so I won't go into it here, but I covered some of the concepts in the coding page of the walkthrough, and enterprising ghost makers can study the menu.dic file I set up for Hunter/Smoker and see how I put it together.

//The complexity of this file depends on how customized you want your menus. If you just want to leave them as they are, then all you'll have to do is replace dialogue appropriately. Many of the options here can be ignored if you don't care. You only have to fill in the things that interest you! The default template dialogue will handle anything you don't. If you get bored or tired, you can skip a lot of these if it comes down to it. You can always go back and fill them in later too. Your ghost will function fine either way!

//And of course, this file will always be waiting for you when you've gotten more familiar with ghosts and want to add cool features! It can be a flexible playground, but don't feel too stressed out about it. As mentioned, just fill in what comes to you and the template dialogue will cover the rest.



//Make sure to read the walkthrough (http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/) for more details about how to properly format ghost dialogue!
//I will reiterate that you should be editing these in Notepad++, and in particular, you should set the Language to C (or Java I guess) to properly highlight all the text. It will make things A LOT EASIER for you, trust me! It will also help you keep track of your brackets in case you forget some. If you click on a line with a bracket in Notepad++, it should highlight where the other bracket ends, or turn purple if there's no finishing bracket (which you should definitely fix!)
//It will also highlight my commented lines in green, so you'll know where they are. Any line beginning with // is a commented line that the code will not read. It's just for your reference!

//If you see a big block of commented text you want to uncomment, highlight the text and then hit ctrl-shift-k in Notepad++ and that should uncomment it. Mostly this is intended for advanced users.


//--OpenSakuraMenu
//This is a bit of intro dialogue before the main character opens their menu. You can see below that there are three pieces of separate dialogue listed before it goes to MenuRun. The character will randomly choose one of those pieces of dialogue before opening the rest of their menu. You can customize this with individual greetings for the character, such as "Yes, %(username)?" or "Need something, %(username)?" or things like that. Note that none of the lines end with \e!
//The \b2 tag tells the ghost to use their big balloon for this dialogue. If your menu has a lot of stuff, this'll probably look better than the small one.
//If you don't want multiple responses before opening the menu, you can delete the dialogue and just leave MenuRun.

	  //I briefly touched in bootend.dic about \q, but I'll again cover it here. Pay very close attention to how this bit of dialogue is formatted. You'll see it goes \![*]\q[Displayed Name,linkedfunction]. Breaking it down, \![*] puts the balloon's option icon in front of the choice (usually a > or something), \q sets up the choice, Displayed Name which is the text that will display in the ghost's balloon, then linkedfunction, which is what the choice is linked to when the user clicks it. As you go through this file, look at how every menu option is set up, and you will see they all follow this format, give or take a \![*]. If you're going to be adding new options to menus or creating your own functions and such, make sure you follow this format and learn it well. Make sure to read the coding page of the walkthrough.

//*********************Advanced User Info*******************************
//Some of you may be wondering why some of these Select.options lead to another function. Why not just put the config menu coding under Select.configmenu, instead of linking to TalkConfig?
//Basically any function that's preceded with Select. is limited in its complexity and can only be called within its own .dic file in my experience. Why should you care, you ask? Well, if you're going to link to this function any other way, such as linking it in other .dic files or as a page in a menu, it needs to be a stand-alone function so it can be properly called. I'm pretty sure.
//The basic jist is this; if you're going to reuse whatever it is the option leads to, you should make it its own function. Otherwise, you can leave it in Select.option. As a rule of thumb I'd probably put any complicated stuff in its own function, then use the Select.option to call the full function as you can see above. Simple dialogue responses to a choice can stay as a Select.option though (Like "Do you like going to raves and partying? Yes/No"). Study what stays as a Select.option and what links to another Function as we go through the file.

A lot of that is fairly complicated though, so I won't get into it here. Advanced Users can pick up Hunter and Smoker and study their menu.dic to see how I did it though, and those who read the coding page of the walkthrough and want to make their own functions can feel free to add them here.

//--Test Variable --------------------------------------------------------
//I briefly mentioned the test variable in bootend.dic and possibly in etc.dic as well, I'm not sure. What exactly is the test variable? Basically, it's a place you can plug in anything you want to test out. While you can use Script Input to test most of your ghost's dialogue, there are some lines it just can't do, and it can't help you test choices. But the test variable can!
//You can also use this to test functions as I mentioned above by adding \![raise,function] at the end of it, although you can do this with Script Input as well. Advanced Users, the test variable is also great for testing out any new stuff you may add to your ghost, like mode settings, item values, functions, raising or lowering numbers, what have you, particularly if you have a bunch you want to change all at once.

//It is ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA to test your dialogue! If you won't check it with the test variable, at least test it with Script Input! It'll save you so much trouble!

Select.testvariable

	"\1\s[10]Testing!\e"
